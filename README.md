# Belief base revision

Python implementation of entrenchment-based revision in belief bases.

## About the project
The project is part of the course [02180 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2018-2019/02180) of DTU.

## Algorithms

* **Entailment check**:  
  Based on the algorithm in the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. The implementation has been adapted from the [aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/) repository (MIT license).
* **Finite partial entrenchment ranking**:  
  Based on the algorithms in [Applications of Belief Revision](http://research.it.uts.edu.au/magic/Mary-Anne/publications/BeliefRevisionApplicationsM-AWilliams.pdf) by Mary-Anne Williams, 1996.
